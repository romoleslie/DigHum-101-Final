Background: 
There are over 5.6 million Airbnb listings all over the world, eight thousand of which are located in San Francisco. With so many options varying in price and features, as a hostee, it is important to know how you can find the Airbnb that fits your needs and your price range. In order to select the best option, you will need to know some information regarding factors that impact pricing. As a future or current Airbnb host, you may want to know about factors that can potentially yield a higher revenue on your property.

Project Goal/Purpose:
In this project, I will analyze San Francisco Airbnb data to find useful insights that would facilitate both finding an Airbnb to stay at and finding a good property or property features to invest in.

Research Questions:
What features of an Airbnb listing yeild higher revenue? What features of an Airbnb alter the rental price the most?
